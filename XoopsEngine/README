Xoops Engine
-- Application Development Engine For Web And Mobile


What Is Xoops Engine
Xoops Engine is the next generation of XOOPS, designed as an application development engine for web and mobile. XE is released under a New BSD License and the project is intended to promote a sustainable ecosystem that benefits all contributors and users in technology and business.
Xoops Engine is actively developed by most active and talented XOOPS core developers led by Taiwen Jiang (a.k.a. phppp), who was Project Lead and Core Dev Lead for XOOPS from 2007 to 2011, core developer from 2005 to 2007.
Xoops Engine development is fully encouraged by support from XOOPS founder Ono Kazumi: "I hope that you keep on going with the development of XE, since there is no bright future ahead with X2."
